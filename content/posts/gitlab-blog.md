**TL;DR** Lets create a blog powered by [hugo static site generator][hugo] hosted on
[gitlab pages][gitlab-pages] with a custom https domain registered at
[zeit.co][zeit] and [letsencrypt] for free.

## Some Details

As christmas present on 24th of December 2016 GitLab brought GitLab pages to
the community edition. Those are static files served by a golang webserver. To
trigger an update one enables continuous integration using a `.gitlab.yml` file
containing a recipe that will result in collecting certain assets, so called
artefacts, in a pipeline conventionally named "pages". The corresponding
website to be found at `https://<username-or-namespace>.gitlab.io/<project>/`.
A domain for this website can be configured in the settings. If none is
available zeit.co is a pretty nice and nerdy hoster, offering an api that can
be controlled using an official JavaScript cli tool called `now`. With `now` we
can quickly register a new domain - costs about **15$** for a *.com* domain -
and further create a HTTPS certificate for free using let's encrypt.

## Build a Blog

*The following gives a brief step-to-step tutorial, if something is not working
as expected [please leave me a message][issues].*

- Create a new project on [GitLab][gitlab].
- [Install hugo][hugo-install], it might be already available on your linux
  machine, check `dnf install hugo`, `apt-get install hugo`, `apk install
  hugo`, download the executeables directly, build the gocode or use one of the
  many available docker container - mine is at `docker.io/unused/hugo`.
- Start a new site using `hugo new site blog`.
- Download a theme and extracted it into the themes folder - as a reference you
  can use the [minimo-hugo-theme][minimo-hugo-theme]. Adapt the `config.toml`
  file, set a minimum of theme to minimo and adapt the baseURL. You can find
  the projects pages url on GitLab in the project settings in the pages
  section.
- Init and update a local git repository with `git init && git ci -am "No time
  for proper git usage...". Please use a more appropriate message. Don't
  headstart with a bad history. Push the project to GitLab via `git push origin
  master`.
- One step to activate your pages, create a new file `.gitlab-ci.yml` using
  the GitLab web UI, then choose the predefined auto-template for `hugo`.
  Unfortunately the docker image used did not match the template requirements
  for the hugo version, on demand feel free to use my hugo image and replace
  the images used in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` with `unused/hugo`. *Let me know if
  it is out of date.*
- If you want to register your domain at zeit.co, go there, create an account
  or log in and add your payment details. Afterwards get the tool using
  `npm i -g now` or use yarn if you prefer it.
- Execute `now domain buy DOMAIN.com` to buy a new domain.
- Execute `now dns add DOMAIN.com @ A 52.167.214.135` to point your domain on
  the official GitLab public IP address. If you setup the domain now in the
  gitlab project settings, your website will already be available on the HTTP
  version of your address.
- Finally create a certificate for the domain with the letsencrypt auto tool,
  first `git clone https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt`, then execute
  `./letsencrypt-auto certonly -a manual -d DOMAIN.com` and follow the
  instructions. You will be asked to create a file on your webhost. Simply
  create the file with described content in the `static/` directory of your
  hugo repository and push it. It should be available as soon as the pipeline
  is processed successfully - check the jobs section of your GitLab project.
- As last step update the GitLab project settings, remove the domain and create
  a new one now also using the fullchain.pem and private.pem keys in your
  configuration. Have fun!
